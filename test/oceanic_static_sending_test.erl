	%   _Name="Test Source Device", _EEP="F6-02-01", OcSrvPid ),

	% Of course Enoceanic can send telegrams with changing source EURIDs, so
	% that, despite being a single emitter, it can control independently as many
	% actuators as wanted.

	% If attempting (and failing) to spoof a well-known device:
	%SourceEuridStr = "002ef196",

	% Not to clash (hopefully) with any actual device:
	% (deactivated as we want to use the base EURID of the USB gateway)
	%
	%SourceEuridStr = ?default_emitter_eurid,

	%SourceEurid = oceanic:string_to_eurid( SourceEuridStr ),

	% For example if a newer, simple smart plug learnt this EURID:
	%SourceEurid = oceanic:string_to_eurid( "11111111" ),
	%SourceEurid = oceanic:string_to_eurid( "22222222" ),

	%SourceEurid = oceanic:string_to_eurid( "44223344" ),
	%SourceEurid = oceanic:string_to_eurid( "002F50D6" ),

	% For example if our first smart plug learnt this EURID:
	SourceEurid = oceanic:get_oceanic_eurid( OcSrvPid ),
	%SourceEurid = oceanic:string_to_eurid( "ffa2df00" ),
	%SourceEurid = oceanic:string_to_eurid( "fea2df00" ),


	% We create a device for the source, so that we can decode by ourselves the
	% telegram that we will forge (in order to check its generation):

	%EepId = oceanic_generated:get_first_for_eep_strings( <<"F6-02-01">> ),

	%SourceDeviceRec = #enocean_device{ eurid=SourceEurid,
	%                                   name= <<"Test Source Device">>,

	%InitialDeviceTable = table:new( [ { SourceEurid, SourceDeviceRec } ] ),

	% Both forms, with a target (hence with optional data) or not, will work:
	MaybeTargetEurid = oceanic:get_broadcast_eurid(),
	%MaybeTargetEurid = undefined,

	%basic_utils:ignore_unused( [ SourceEurid, MaybeTargetEurid ] ),

	% Any given target device, typically a smart plug, must have already learnt
	% the Oceanic gateway for this test to act on it. Note that two kinds of
	% learnings may have been done: either as a simple button or as a double
	% rocker (we recommend that setting); depending on that the telegrams sent
	% by Oceanic will be interpreted differently (e.g. in the former case,
	% either run of this test will toggle the plug, whereas in the latter case
	% the plug will be switched on then off at each test execution.

	% These two buttons are actually considered independently, and for a test
	% where the emitter is registered only by pressing one of the buttons
	% (e.g. the "off" one) as a single input contact (hence not as a double
	% rocker), the "on" one has no special interest, only the "off" one is taken
	% account by the target device, a (double-rocker) switch.

	SwitchOnButton = button_ao,
	SwitchOffButton = button_ai,

	% We first encode all telegrams of interest, so that we can send them
	% afterwards as wanted and in any order:


	% Apparently, after a telegram notifying a press or a release has been sent,
	% all telegrams of the same type will be ignored. So a proper transition has
	% to send them both (and in the correct order: 'pressed' then 'released').


	% Double-rocker device has its top A rocker pressed, based on with a single
	% subtelegram, not targeting any specified address (not even the address for
	% broadcast transmission); its EEP is double_rocker_switch (F6-02-01):
	%

	% In some test settings, the "off" button may have been learnt as a single

	% any action; and this action is to toggle on/off the switch.

	% Here we suppose that for this test the switch was registered as a double
	% rocker (not a single-contact button), is initially off and that we want to
	% switch it on temporarily (for one second); we have to:

	test_facilities:display( "First we press (and then also release) the "
		"'switch on' button, '~ts' (which must have already been learnt), "
		"typically in order to switch on a lamp.", [ SwitchOnButton ] ),

	% The actual switching on depends on both telegrams:
	oceanic:send( PressOnButtonTelegram, OcSrvPid ),
	% No waiting needed:
	oceanic:send( ReleaseOnButtonTelegram, OcSrvPid ),


	test_facilities:display( "Then, after a short waiting, we press "
		"(and then release) the 'switch off' button, '~ts', typically "
		"to switch off the lamp.", [ SwitchOffButton ] ),

	timer:sleep( 1000 ),

	oceanic:send( PressOffButtonTelegram, OcSrvPid ),
	oceanic:send( ReleaseOffButtonTelegram, OcSrvPid ),

	% May be useful if the sending corresponds to a request:
	receive_event(),

	oceanic:stop( OcSrvPid ),

	% So that any final trace sent when stopping can be transmitted and seen (as
	% stopping is an asynchronous operation):
	%
	timer:sleep( 1000 ),
